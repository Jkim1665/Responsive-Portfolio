                    <p> My name is Jin and I'm a Korean-American (2nd Gen) who loves sports, music, and programming?</p>
                    <p> To be honest, I don't know how I ended up here... and if I have any talent for this subject; one thing
                        I do know is my work-ethic is aiight. My career trajectory changed in my early twenty's when I realized
                        that, although I love helping people, I needed to help myself. I needed to master more than just
                        the things I was comfortable with. One day, I met this programmer, at one of my old jobs, who told
                        me to give this coding thing a try and that was the seed that got planted 2 years ago. I put that
                        idea on the sidelines. I kept jumping from job to job to pay bills and along the way learned more
                        about myself and developed my soft skills. I was bit of a brute. One memorable lesson I learned was
                        in the kitchen. He said "many things can betray you (in life) but a knife and a fire never will."
                        Needless to say, I experienced many cuts and burns. </p>
                    <p>The next eye-opening event was when I began to work at a catering job for a tech company. We made lunches
                        for them everyday and was one of the reasons why I wanted to work at this specific job. One day when
                        delivering food, I saw the work enviornment and thought to myself, damn these guys can drink and
                        work?! Long story short, I met all types of people along the way who pushed me to this path and I'm
                        so grateful for support. I don't need to be the best programmer in the class. I just want to be the
                        best version of myself.</p>
